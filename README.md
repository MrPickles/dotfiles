# Andrew's Dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles.

These dotfiles are best used with zsh, [oh-my-zsh][oh-my-zsh], and the
[solarized][solarized] colorscheme.
The configuration has powerline-based fonts status bars for vim and tmux, and
uses [Powerlevel10k][powerlevel10k] as its zsh theme.
Thus you'll need to patch to a font that supports powerline and Font Awesome
symbols.

## Prequisites

These dotfiles contain the following software dependencies:

* Linux or MacOS
* Vim 8.0+

There currently is no Windows support.
However, MacOS and most flavors of Linux should work fine.
These dotfiles use Vim's new [native package manager][vim8] in order to
distribute modules in an organized fashion, so versions of Vim before 8 will not
function properly.

## Setting up your Local Machine

_[Go to the next section](#installation) if you have already configured these
dotfiles on your machine once, or if you are SSHing into another machine.
These setup instructions only need to be done once on a local machine._

New machines require two tasks to be done which are not part of the setup
script:

* installing (and using) Powerline/Font Awesome-compatible fonts, and
* using the Solarized colorscheme.

### MacOS

#### Installing Fonts with Custom Glyph Support

We will be using [Nerd Fonts][nerd-fonts] to patch in all of our symbols.
This font aggregator is nice in the sense that it collects many different glyphs
from various sources; we'll be using a lot of different symbols!

You'll first want to install a pre-patched font.
There are multiple ways to do this.
If you prefer to use the browser, download `Droid Sans Mono Nerd Font
Complete.otf` from the Nerd Fonts [prepatched fonts folder][prepatched].
Clicking on the file from Finder, after downloading it should be sufficient.

Alternatively, if you have Homebrew, you can install it from the command line.

```shell
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew cask install font-droidsansmono-nerd-font
```

Next, you'll want to configure iTerm to use the new font.

1. Go to the `Text` tab in your current iTerm profile and select the option to
   `Use a different font for non-ASCII text`.
2. In the same tab, select `Droid Sans Mono Nerd Font` as the font for non-ASCII
   text.

The Powerline symbols included in the font might not align well.
As a remedy, iTerm has a `Use built-in Powerline glyphs` option to substitute
the characters with its own built-in alternative characters.
I'd recommend checking that option.

The Text section of my iTerm settings looks like the picture below.
For ASCII text, I use `Menlo Regular` (which is a native font) and use 14pt for
all font types.

#### Solarized on iTerm

The Solarized colors for iTerm can be found in its
[official repository][solarized-repo].
Import [`Solarized Dark.itermcolors`][itermcolors] as a colorscheme for iTerm.
In the `Colors` section of your iTerm profile, use the `Solarized Dark` preset.

#### Enable Copy/Paste in Tmux

On Macs, `pbcopy` and `pbpaste` don't natively work in tmux.
Luckly there's a [Homebrew][homebrew] formula to fix that.

```shell
brew install reattach-to-user-namespace
```

The tmux configuration will do the rest for you.
Note that this only applies to machines running MacOS.

#### Enable Mouse Wheel Scrolling in Vim on iTerm

If using iTerm, setting `Scroll wheel sends arrow keys when in alternate screen
mode.` to `Yes` will allow trackpad scrolling while in Vim.
The setting can be found in the advanced preferences.

### Linux

#### Downloading Fonts for Linux

Similarly to that of MacOS, you'll need to fetch modified fonts.

```shell
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/fonts
cd ~/.local/share/fonts
curl -fLo "Droid Sans Mono for Powerline Nerd Font Complete.otf" \
  https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/raw/master/patched-fonts/DroidSansMono/complete/Droid%20Sans%20Mono%20Nerd%20Font%20Complete.otf
```

#### Solarized on Ubuntu Terminal

To get Solarized on the Ubuntu Terminal, you will want to create a new profile.
Then you will follow the instructions in
[gnome-terminal-colors-solarized][gnome-terminal-colors-solarized] to set the
color scheme.

Start by creating a new profile on the terminal emulator.

![Creating a new terminal profile](.images/new_profile.png)

Set that profile to be the default profile upon terminal open.

![Using solarized as the default terminal](.images/new_terminal.png)

Finally clone the
[gnome-terminal-colors-solarized repo][gnome-terminal-colors-solarized] and
follow its installation instructions.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Anthony25/gnome-terminal-colors-solarized.git
cd gnome-terminal-colors-solarized
./set_dark.sh
```

### Other optional tools

There are a few recommended (but optional) tools you can install to improve your
shell experience in general.

* [`diff-so-fancy`][diff-so-fancy]: Diff-so-fancy is a diffing tool that gives a
  nicer diff than the git default.
* [`rg`][rg]: Ripgrep is a faster alternative over `ag`, `ack`, and `grep`.
  It has the exact same usage as `ag` and is likely more preferable in all use
  cases.
* [`fzf`][fzf]: Fzf is a general purpose fuzzy funder.
* [`fd`][fd]: `fd` is a faster alternative to the `find` command.
  It works very well when paired with `fzf`.
* `tree`: This will display the directory structure as a tree. We use it to
  improve the output of `ALT-C` from `fzf`.
* [`highlight`][highlight]: This adds coloring to output. We also use it to
  improve the output of `CTRL-T` from `fzf`.

You should install all of these independently of this dotfile repo.
(This also includes figuring out how to install them.)
Most of these are Homebrew packages on MacOS (or a target in most Linux package
managers).

## Installation

Installation is as simple as downloading and running the install script.
The install script will run the configuration script, which fetches oh-my-zsh
and symlinks the dotfiles to your home directory.

```shell
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrPickles/dotfiles/master/install.sh | sh
```

Alternatively, you can manually clone the repository and run the `configure.sh`
script.

```shell
git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:MrPickles/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./configure.sh -t build
```

You will also likely need to manually change your shell to `zsh` if you are
currently using a different shell.

```shell
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

## Customizing

You can customize vim, git, tmux, and zsh for each specific machine.
Just put any additional configurations in `~/.zshrc.local`, `~/.tmux.conf.local`
`~/.gitconfig.local` or `~/.vimrc.local`.
Sample local configs are included in this repo.
Custom git configurations can also be placed in `~/.gitconfig`.

## Teardown

To clean up the dotfiles, run the configuration script with the `clean`
argument.
It will remove all symlinks, but zsh and oh-my-zsh will be untouched.
If you wish to remove those, you will have to manually delete them.

```shell
cd ~/.dotfiles
./configure.sh -t clean
rm -rf ~/.oh-my-zsh # optionally remove oh-my-zsh
chsh -s $(which bash) # optionally change shell back to bash
