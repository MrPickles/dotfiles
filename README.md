# Andrew's Dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles.

```
curl https://andrew.cloud/dotfiles.sh | bash
```

![Screenshot of my dotfiles](.images/screenshot.png)

These dotfiles are intended for use with zsh, [oh-my-zsh][oh-my-zsh], and the
[solarized][solarized] colorscheme.
The configuration uses powerline-based status bars for vim and tmux and
[Powerlevel10k][powerlevel10k] as its zsh theme.

## Prequisites

These dotfiles contain the following software dependencies:

* Linux or MacOS
* Vim 8.0+ (or Neovim 0.3.1+)

There currently is no Windows support.
However, MacOS and most flavors of Linux should work fine.

## Setting up your Local Machine

_[Go to the next section](#installation) if you have already configured these
dotfiles on your machine once, or if you are SSHing into another machine.
These setup instructions only need to be done once on a local machine._

New machines require two tasks to be done which are not part of the setup
script:

* installing (and using) Powerline/Font Awesome-compatible fonts, and
* using the Solarized colorscheme.

### MacOS

#### Installing Fonts with Custom Glyph Support

We will be using [Nerd Fonts][nerd-fonts] to patch in all of our symbols.
This font aggregator is nice in the sense that it collects many different glyphs
from various sources.
(We'll be using a lot of different symbols!)

Follow the [Powerlevel10k font instructions][p10k-fonts] to install the proper
fonts.

```shell
p10k configure
```

The Text section of my iTerm settings looks like the picture below.

![Text section of iTerm settings](.images/iterm_options.png)

#### Solarized on iTerm

The Solarized colors for iTerm can be found in its
[official repository][solarized-repo].
(You won't need to download it.)
In the `Colors` section of your iTerm profile, use the `Solarized Dark` preset.

#### Enable Copy/Paste in Tmux

On Macs, `pbcopy` and `pbpaste` don't natively work in tmux.
Luckly there's a [Homebrew][homebrew] formula to fix that.

```shell
brew install reattach-to-user-namespace
```

The tmux configuration will do the rest for you.
Note that this only applies to machines running MacOS.

#### Enable Mouse Wheel Scrolling in Vim on iTerm

If using iTerm, setting `Scroll wheel sends arrow keys when in alternate screen
mode.` to `Yes` will allow trackpad scrolling while in Vim.
The setting can be found in the advanced preferences.

#### Enabling the Meta Key on iTerm

If using iTerm, you may want to set the option key mode to `Esc+` to make it be
a meta key.
It's used for a few shortcuts, such as resizing tmux panes.

#### Bold Text Color

Uncheck the `Brighten Bold Text` option in iTerm if all bold text is gray.

### Linux

#### Downloading Fonts for Linux

Similarly to that of MacOS, you'll need to fetch modified fonts.
We'll install the same font that we use for MacOS.
Follow the [Powerlevel10k font instructions][p10k-fonts] to install the proper
fonts.

#### Solarized on Ubuntu Terminal

To get Solarized on the Ubuntu Terminal, you will want to create a new profile.
The solarized colorscheme should be a default option on most modern terminals.
If it's not default, follow the instructions in
[gnome-terminal-colors-solarized][gnome-terminal-colors-solarized] to set the
color scheme.

### Other optional tools

There are a few recommended (but optional) tools you can install to improve your
shell experience in general.

* [`delta`][delta]: Delta is a diffing tool that gives a nicer diff than the git
  default.
* [`rg`][rg]: Ripgrep is a faster alternative over `ag`, `ack`, and `grep`.
  It has the exact same usage as `ag` and is likely more preferable in all use
  cases.
* [`fzf`][fzf]: Fzf is a general purpose fuzzy funder.
* [`fd`][fd]: `fd` is a faster alternative to the `find` command.
  It works very well when paired with `fzf`.
* `tree`: This will display the directory structure as a tree. We use it to
  improve the output of `ALT-C` from `fzf`.
* [`bat`][bat]: An improved version of `cat`. We use it for the file previews
  when running `CTRL-T` from `fzf`.

You should install all of these independently of this dotfile repo.
(This also includes figuring out how to install them.)
Most of these are Homebrew packages on MacOS (or a target in most Linux package
managers).

## Installation

Installation is as simple as downloading and running the install script.
The install script will run the configuration script, which fetches oh-my-zsh
and symlinks the dotfiles to your home directory.

```shell
curl https://andrew.cloud/dotfiles.sh | bash
# or
wget -qO- https://andrew.cloud/dotfiles.sh | bash
```

Alternatively, you can manually clone the repository and run the `setup.sh`
script.

```shell
git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:MrPickles/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./setup.sh -t build
```

You will also likely need to manually change your shell to `zsh` if you are
currently using a different shell.

```shell
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

### Vim

We use the [vim-plug][] as our editor plugin manager.
When first opening Vim, run the following command.

```
:PlugInstall
```

## Customizing

You can customize zsh, vim, tmux, and git for each specific machine.
Just put any additional configurations in `~/.zshrc.local`, `~/.vimrc.local`,
or `~/.tmux.conf.local`.
Sample local configs are included in this repo.
Custom git configurations can be placed in `~/.gitconfig`.
The normal git config file is not put under version control, so it's safe to put
machine-specific tokens in it.

## Teardown

To clean up the dotfiles, run the configuration script with the `clean`
argument.
It will remove all symlinks, but zsh and oh-my-zsh will be untouched.
If you wish to remove those, you will have to manually delete them.

```shell
cd ~/.dotfiles
./setup.sh -t clean
rm -rf ~/.oh-my-zsh # optionally remove oh-my-zsh
chsh -s $(which bash) # optionally change shell back to bash
